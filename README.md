# hello-world
the first repository for me
Hi, Humans
**i'm bill**
an alien from a planet which has no basketball. So when i landed on this planet,
i was totally into a guy called Steph Curry. He is a two-MVP player. So I call myself BillMVP.
And another interesting thing is programming. It's a little bit harder but I can get over it.
So I pray to the God of programming. 
```
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
 printf('Hello World !');
 return 0;
}
```
